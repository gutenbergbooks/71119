<p>In the art of cooking the “Old Southern Mammy” has
few equals and recognizes no peers.</p>

<p>The following recipes have, with great patience and
kindly perseverance, been drawn from the treasured memories
of Aunt Caroline Pickett, a famous old Virginia cook,
the “pinch of this” and “just a smacker of that” so wonderfully
and mysteriously combined by the culinary masters of
the Southland have been carefully and scientifically analyzed
and recorded in this volume, and after a practical test of each
recipe herein presented, the author can, with the fullest degree
of confidence, recommend the following as the most attractive
and economical combination ever presented.</p>

<p>The variety covers a range sufficient to fully gratify the
demands of the modest as well as the exacting tastes of the
most pronounced epicure, and have been carefully classified
and alphabetically arranged for the convenience of the housewife,
and a page has been left blank opposite each page of
recipes for her own favorite dishes. It is the author’s intention
that this little book become a veritable treasure trove
of dainty, appetizing and tasty dishes.</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p>In sweet memories of a happy childhood spent in the
atmosphere of the plantations and cabins of Virginia under
the benign influence of my Dear Old Southern Mammy,
Aunt Caroline, this volume is affectionately dedicated.</p>

may be used. After beating the dough, put it into a vessel
to rise in warm place for about three hours. When risen,
roll it lightly until about one-fourth of an inch thick. Then

the cream sauce. Spread each piece of bread when toasted
with cream sauce, and then grate yolks over the top. Return
to oven and heat just before serving.</p>

a boil slowly, taking care the sugar does not scorch before

<p>Put a pint of New Orleans molasses over the fire in a

a little, dropped into cold water, becomes brittle. This candy
must be stirred constantly while it is cooking or it will
scorch. When it reaches the brittle stage, add a teaspoon of
vinegar and a tablespoon of butter and pour into well-buttered
pans. Mark into shape with a buttered knife after the
candy begins to form and before it is really hard.</p>


<h3>CREAM PEPPERMINT DROPS</h3>

until it spins thread from the tip of a spoon dipped into it.
Take from the stove, leave it untouched until it is about blood-warm,
then stir steadily, always in one direction until the mixture
begins to become creamy. Flavor to taste with essence
of peppermint, adding this cautiously so as not to get the
flavor too strong. Drop by the teaspoonful upon waxed paper,
being careful not to put the drops so close together that they
will run into each other. A candy dipper is even better for
this purpose than a teaspoon.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
